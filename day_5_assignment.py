# ðŸ’¡ **Question 1**

# Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array

# You are given a **0-indexed** 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with Â m rows and n columns using **all** the elements from original.

# The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (**inclusive**) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (**inclusive**) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

# Return *an* m x n *2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible*.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2

# **Output:** [[1,2],[3,4]]

# **Explanation:** The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.

# The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.

# The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

original = [1,2,3,4]
m = 2
n = 2

if len(original) != m * n:
    print([])

ans = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
for i, num in enumerate(original):
    ans[i // n][i % n] = num
print(ans)

class Solution:
  def construct2DArray(self, origina, m, n):
    if len(original) != m * n:
      return []

    ans = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    for i, num in enumerate(original):
      ans[i // n][i % n] = num

    return ans


    
# ðŸ’¡ **Question 2**

# You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

# Given the integer n, return *the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build*.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** n = 5

# **Output:** 2

# **Explanation:** Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


n = 8

l = 1
r = n 
res = 0
# 1 2 3 4 5
while l<r:
    mid = (l + r)//2 
    coins = (mid / 2) * (mid+1)
    if coins > n:
        r -=  1
    else:
        l += 1
        res = max(res,mid)              
    
print(res)


# ðŸ’¡ **Question 3**

# Given an integer array nums sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order*.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]

# **Output:** [0,1,9,16,100]

# **Explanation:** After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].

# After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

class Solution:
  def sortedSquares(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = [0] * n

    while n:
      n -= 1
      if abs(nums[l]) > abs(nums[r]):
        ans[n] = nums[l] * nums[l]
        l += 1
      else:
        ans[n] = nums[r] * nums[r]
        r -= 1

    return ans




# ðŸ’¡ **Question 4**

# Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return *a list* answer *of size* 2 *where:*

# - answer[0] *is a list of all **distinct** integers in* nums1 *which are **not** present in* nums2*.*
# - answer[1] *is a list of all **distinct** integers in* nums2 *which are **not** present in* nums1.

# **Note** that the integers in the lists may be returned in **any** order.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]

# **Output:** [[1,3],[4,6]]

# **Explanation:**

# For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].

# For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].


class Solution:
  def findDifference(self, nums1, nums2):
    set1 = set(nums1)
    set2 = set(nums2)
    return [set1 - set2, set2 - set1]


# ðŸ’¡ **Question 5**

# Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, *return the distance value between the two arrays*.

# The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2

# **Output:** 2

# **Explanation:**

# For arr1[0]=4 we have:

# |4-10|=6 > d=2

# |4-9|=5 > d=2

# |4-1|=3 > d=2

# |4-8|=4 > d=2

# For arr1[1]=5 we have:

# |5-10|=5 > d=2

# |5-9|=4 > d=2

# |5-1|=4 > d=2

# |5-8|=3 > d=2

# For arr1[2]=8 we have:

# **|8-10|=2 <= d=2**

# **|8-9|=1 <= d=2**

# |8-1|=7 > d=2

# **|8-8|=0 <= d=2**



arr1 = [4,5,8]
arr2 = [10,9,1,8]
d = 2


count = 0
for i in arr1:
    for j in arr2:
        if 0 < abs(i-j) <=d:
            count += 1

# print(count)
# print(sum(all(abs(a - b) > d for b in arr2) for a in arr1))
            
# print([0 < abs(i-j) <= d  for j in arr2 for i in arr1].count(True))


# ðŸ’¡ **Question 6**

# Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears **once** or **twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears **twice***.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

# **Output:**

# [2,3]


nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
ans = []
nums_count =  {i:nums.count(i) for i in  nums}
for i,j in nums_count.items():
    print(i,j)
    if j>1:
        ans.append(i)
        
print(ans)
        
    
 
# ðŸ’¡ **Question 7**

# Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

# - [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# - [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

# Notice that **rotating** an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

# Given the sorted rotated array nums of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

# **Output:** 1

# **Explanation:**

# The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

class Solution:
  def findMin(self, nums):
    l = 0
    r = len(nums) - 1

    while l < r:
      m = (l + r) // 2
      if nums[m] < nums[r]:
        r = m
      else:
        l = m + 1

    return nums[l]


s = Solution()
print(s.findMin(nums))
# ðŸ’¡ **Question 8**

# An integer array original is transformed into a **doubled** array changed by appending **twice the value** of every element in original, and then randomly **shuffling** the resulting array.

# Given an array changed, return original *if* changed *is a **doubled** array. If* changed *is not a **doubled** array, return an empty array. The elements in* original *may be returned in **any** order*.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** changed = [1,3,4,2,6,8]

# **Output:** [1,3,4]

# **Explanation:** One possible original array could be [1,3,4]:

# - Twice the value of 1 is 1 * 2 = 2.
# - Twice the value of 3 is 3 * 2 = 6.
# - Twice the value of 4 is 4 * 2 = 8.

# Other original arrays could be [4,3,1] or [3,1,4].
